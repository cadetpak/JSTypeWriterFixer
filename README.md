js_scroll
=========

Exercise for the CodingDojo's Javascript course.  See the learning platform to see how you should improve the codes.  There are several bugs with the codes which are intentional. :)


^ Above is original readMe.
Most of code was already written, and included 2 small bugs.
I simplified and stripped down code a little further to better understand functionality.
Heavily commented.
